/*!
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * PEOCHAIN-DEMO: RUST CONSENSUS LIB
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This library implements the PoSyg + DCS consensus logic.
 *
 * PRINCIPLES:
 * - SRP: lib.rs focuses exclusively on consensus logic.
 * - OCP: The ConsensusEngine trait can be extended with new consensus algorithms.
 * - LSP: Each engine implementing ConsensusEngine can be substituted interchangeably.
 * - ISP: Only methods truly needed by a consensus engine are declared here.
 * - DIP: High-level code depends on this abstraction rather than concrete implementations.
 * - DRY: Shared logic for synergy scoring is centralized in the synergy module.
 * - KISS: Straightforward synergy computation and validator management.
